	  		<h2>Brief History</h2>
	  		<div>
			    <h3>St. Maria Faustina Kowalska</h3>

				<h4>APOSTLE AND SECRETARY OF MERCY</h4>
				<p>August 25, 1905 - Helen Kowalska was born in Glogowiec, Poland.  From a young age, she was known for her love of prayer, diligence, obedience, and concern for the poor.  She was called to the religious life during a vision of the suffering Christ.</p>

				<p>August 1, 1925 - She entered the Congregation of the sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and took the name Sr. Maria Faustina of the Most Blessed Sacrament; lived as member of the Congregation for 13 years residing in Cracow, Plock and Vilnius, where she worked as a cook, gardener, and porter.<br/>
				Her life in the convent was filled with extraordinary gifts, such as revelations, visions, hidden stigmata, participation in the Passion of the Lord, bilocation, reading of human souls, prophecy, and the rare gift of mystical insights. The Lord chose St. Faustina as the Apostle and Secretary of Mercy, so she would share the urgent message of the Divine Mercy with our troubled modern world.</p>

				<p>In the 1930s - St. Faustina wrote a diary of some 600 pages recording the revelations she was receiving about God's mercy.  She maintained this diary at the specific request of her spiritual director and confessor, Fr. Michael Sopocko, and later at the command of the Lord Jesus Himself.  In it she faithfully wrote down all of the Lord's wishes and described the encounters between her soul and HIM.</p>

				<p>October 5, 1938 - At the age of 33, she died in Cracow after long suffering borne with great patience.</p>

				<p>April 30, 2000 - Blessed John Paul II canonized Sr. Faustina as the first saint of the great Jubilee Year, on Mercy Sunday; declared the First Sunday of Easter, as Divine Mercy Sunday throughout the universal Church.  Now, our mission is to spread the message of the Divine Mercy in the third millennium.</p>

  		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  		<div>
	  		<ol>
	  			<li><h4>What is Divine Mercy?</h4>
				It is the gentle mastery of Christ. "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,  and I will give you rest... For my yolk is easy, and my burden light." Mt 11: 28-30.<br/>
				Divine Mercy is the greatest attribute of God.  God in His humanity came down to earth in Jesus who through His teachings, healing miracles, forgiving of sins, and submitting to the will of His Father by dying on the cross for the salvation of souls. Through the revelations and messages that Jesus gave to St. Faustina based on her diary, Divine Mercy in My Soul, we discover how the Love of God is the flower and Mercy is the fruit.</li>

				<li><h4>Who is Divine Mercy?</h4>
				Jesus the Son of God is the Divine Mercy, the King of Mercy. From Creation to Redemption we see His abounding merciful love and faithfulness to His people. In the course of history,  people continuously entrusted themselves, both when stricken with misfortune and when they became aware of their sins, to God's ocean of mercy. Recognizing our human weaknesses and sins, Jesus is always ready to pour out His mercy upon us, for He is Love and Mercy itself.  All He wants is that we ask for His mercy and to trust Him.</li>

				<li><h4>Why are we building?</h4>
				The Divine Mercy Apostolate is a worldwide spiritual move-ment transcending faith in action by drawing souls to Jesus, the Divine Mercy.  Since the canonization of St. Faustina, the Divine Mercy message and devotion has spread throughout the world.  The Western United States is ideally located for a suitable shrine to serve as the gateway to the Pacific Rim, Central and South America.</li>

				<li><h4>How long will it take to build the Shrine?</h4>
				The project will be completed in phases over a 5-year period; as outlined on the back page of this document.  Sufficient capital funding will be necessary to enact Phases I through IV.</li>

				<li><h4>What will be included?</h4>
				The Divine Mercy Shrine will include serene prayer gardens with grottos dedicated to our Holy Mary Mother of Mercy, St. Faustina the Apostle of Mercy and Blessed John Paul II our Mercy Pope, all suitable for private prayer, meditation and contemplation.  There will be pathways for the Stations of the Cross and Mysteries of the Rosary.  The centerpiece will be the small chapel for a place of worship, adoration, veneration and silent conversations with God. Family memorials will be available in various locations of the Shrine.</li>

				<li><h4>How much will it cost?</h4>
				The total cost of the project is estimated to be $7 million including the cost of studies, permits and construction. </li>

				<li><h4>Who will benefit from the shrine and center?</h4>
				The Divine Mercy Shrine is intended to win souls for Christ.  This is an open door to all people who seek His unfathomable Mercy imparted by the graces promised through this Image of the Divine Mercy, especially the 37 million Californians and people of the Western United States within close proximity to the shrine. This will be a pilgrim site open to all people throughout the world who hunger and thirst for the Love and Mercy of Jesus Christ.</li>

				<li><h4>Does the Western Region of the USA need to be involved in the Divine Mercy Shrine Project to be successful?</h4>
				Yes, the Divine Mercy Apostolate belongs to all of us and everyone is invited to become more involved.  We are invited to be apostles of Mercy; messengers of HIS love and mercy.  Jesus offers us an image, a vessel, that leads us to say: "Jesus, I trust in You."</li>

  		<h4>Pilgrims visiting Sr. Faustina's convent (Vilnius, Poland) </h4>
		<p>This is the convent where St. Faustina lived while she stayed in Vilnius during the 1930's. St. Faustina referred to Vilnius as "my beloved Vilnius". It was, without doubt, one of the happiest periods of her life, in spite of her debilitating illness. In this convent St. Faustina received the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, did the bulk of her writing in her diaries; was often visited by her spiritual director, Bl. Fr. Sopocko.</p>

		<h4>The Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krak&oacute;w, Poland)  </h4>
		<p>Is a Roman Catholic basilica dedicated to the Divine Mercy devotion, built between 1999-2002. Two Popes and millions of pilgrims from around the world have visited this shrine. In 1966, the remains of St. Faustina were moved to this church and now rest on the altar, below the image of Divine Mercy.</p>

		<h4>Divine Mercy Shrine (Cagayan de Oro, Philippines)</h4>
		<p>This Divine Mercy Hills Shrine, over-looks Macajalar Bay, on the Mindanao island, in the southern part of the Philippines. The nine-hectare land for the Shrine was purchased for a nominal amount and the shrine was constructed by donations.  The shrine was completed in 2008 and has a 50 foot statue of the Divine Mercy Jesus. It serves as a pilgrimage site for Divine Mercy devotees. Church officials in the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro have the Congregation of the Marians overseeing the shrine and serving as official promoters for the Divine Mercy message throughout this region of Southeast Asia.</p>


		<h4>National Shrine of  The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)</h4>
		<p>The National Shrine of The Divine Mercy is a ministry of the Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the authentic promoters of the message of The Divine Mercy. Located in the heart of the Berkshire Hills in western Massachusetts, the Shrine sits on 350 acres, known as Eden Hill. This Shrine offers many opportunities for inspiration and devotion. Pilgrims find refreshment of soul at Mass, confession, the 3 o'clock Chaplet of The Divine Mercy, personal adoration of the Eucharist, visiting smaller shrines grottos and groves; strolling throughout the beautiful grounds. It was dedicated in 1960; honored as a National Shrine in 1996.</p>

		<h4>Divine Mercy Hill Shrine, Chapel and Center (Encinitas, California)</h4>
		<p>Proposed new 3.27 acre site of the Divine Mercy Hills Shrine of Southern California, located in the Diocese of San Diego very near St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church.  The property was dedicated on February 16, 2013 by raising a 20 foot cross on the top of the large hill on the site.
